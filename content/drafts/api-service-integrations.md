# Integrating API Services - Developer Thoughts

API's has become the fundamental building blocks for connecting various business products and services. Businesses are no more restricted to a software vendor lockin. If a specific feature is missing in the traditional system they can always plugin an external service using the API and integrate them.

I have integrated 100's of external API's and based on my experience i would like to jot down my experience  on these API's. There are some API's which i really enjoyed due to their great documentation and simplicity of the endpoint objects.
