Lockdown Survival - Buying Tip :

During these lockdown times, purchasing groceries and other basic items has become tough for everyone. Its' hard to find shopkeepers and it's challenging for them if they not maintain the sales with Social distancing. I have been to a nearby shop (Pazhamudircholai) and the shop is closed due to restrictions from the officers to avoid the que's and groups. 

But in the closed shutter, they have mentioned to message them in WhatsApp or phone on the list of items needed. I sent a message to them and they packed everything (plastic basket) in 30 minutes and they called me to collect them. This has helped to avoid gathering and also you don't need to wait for long time in the que. 

Share this tip to your nearby shop or departmental stores/super market.
